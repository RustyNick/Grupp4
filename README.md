When NodeJs is installed.
Open VSC and inside the editor navigate to the folder named "my-app" in the built in termninal of your text editor.
It will look something like this "cd my-app"

When the folder is chosen in the same terminal you install Material UI and React dom 
using the npm installation metod as shown underneath here:

Material UI
"npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @types/material-ui"
