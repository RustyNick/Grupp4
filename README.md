School project

This project is based on NodeJs and will require NodeJs to work properly.

To install and download NodeJs pick your OS and install accordingly from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

When NodeJs is installed.
Open VSC and inside the editor navigate to the folder named "my-app" in the built in termninal of your text editor.
It will look something like this "cd my-app"

After that is installed you can now type the following in you terminal:
"npm start" 

It should open our project automatically in your choosen browser,
if not just copy the localhost adress from the terminal och paste it to your browser and you now be able to access our project

ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!

ErrorBoundary will get a error at start on the components TodoList.trx and TodoListitem.trx because no data has been inputed yet. Once data has been inserted the console will show no error because it can now find a key.

Optional: in case of error

When the folder "my-app" is chosen open terminal and install Material UI and React dom
using the npm installation metod as shown underneath here:

Material UI
"npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @types/material-ui"
